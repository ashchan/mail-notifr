# Mail Notifr (formerly Gmail Notifr) #

A Gmail Notifier for macOS

## Mail Notifr sunset on March 8th, 2024.

**As this app needs to access Gmail restricted APIs, it's required to complete a CASA security assessment, which is a progress I could NOT get through.**

**I've decided to make the end of its service. Sorry, and thank you.**
